The week of September 18, the entire development staff (about 25
people) headed to St Louis to enjoy Strangeloop, a technical
conference unlike most, where exhibitors give way to working sessions
and emerging languages, libraries, tools and techniques are unveiled
and explored.

Sonian brought the entire dev team to the event and scheduled several
sessions in the days before, including a CEO roundtable where
developers had unfettered access to Sonian’s CEO, Jeff Dickerson.

Where in the past Sonian’s development teams had “split attendance” at
both the Clojure and Ruby on Rails conferences, Strangeloop offered a
unique opportunity to bring the entire development staff together at
one event.  Feedback from the team indicates this was a worthwhile
effort, and at future events, the audience may be broadened to include
Product Management. Patrick Curley, Vice President of Product
Development noted, “Many of our developers are remote, so an event
like this serves an important function in helping to get the teams
better aligned, and in some cases to meet face-to-face for the first
time.

Having such a cutting edge show as a backdrop to the team meeting also
provided vital “group learning” opportunities for these emerging
technologies, which will be critical as Sonian moves forward”.
