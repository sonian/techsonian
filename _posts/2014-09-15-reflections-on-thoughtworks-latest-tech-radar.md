title: Reflections on ThoughtWorks’ Latest Tech Radar
---

I enjoy reading through ThoughtWorks’ Tech Radar every time it comes out.  I heard ThoughtWorker Neal Ford talk about it in a No Fluff conference, and thought it was a great idea for facilitating a conversation within your team or company, and for giving you a personal yardstick for keeping abreast of industry developments.

Company tech radars express a technology risk tolerance profile.  Each “blip” on the radar is an item categorized into one of four quadrants: Techniques, Tools, Platforms, and Languages & Frameworks.  Each blip is also placed into a ring in the radar; the rings represent the risk associated with the blip.  The rings are: Adopt, Trial, Assess, and Hold.  The “Adopt” ring indicates low-risk.  “Trial” items are less well understood, but perhaps on their way to “Adopt” status.  “Assess” items are high risk because of a lack of information, and “Hold” items are a high risk because of plenty of hard-earned information.  It’s highly unlikely any two companies’ tech radars are the same, and looking at a radar gives you a snapshot of a company’s technical strengths, plans and direction, and (perhaps by omission) their weaknesses.

For me, ThoughtWorks’ radar paints a picture of their consulting activities, and seemingly takes a few fun jabs at the pain points those folks must commonly endure.  Obviously they’re a software consultancy, and they do lots of web-based front ends, some mobile work, typically with JVM or perhaps .NET backends.  They are often working in Big Corporate land, and the radar is their declaration of war on the old “enterprise” ways, and a statement of intent: the Tools quadrant is aggressive compared with the other three quadrants.  It’s also laden with JavaScript and web front end tools. JavaScript proliferation is called out in their headlines. I imagine there are lively discussions on their internal JavaScript IRC channel!

A Brave New World?

Connectedness is essentially an assumption. The ongoing revelations from Snowden and trivial access to sophisticated intrusion and malware toolkits hopefully refocuses all of us software types on on the security of our customers’ data.

I enjoyed the double negative of “Ignoring OWASP Top 10” (Techniques #26; hold) being placed in “Hold”, and thank the Germans for providing us with a word for keeping only that which is necessary: Datensparsamkeit (Techniques #19; assess).  If the system is compromised, what is potentially lost or exposed?  Sloppy logging is an attack vector, and should be considered when building and maintaining systems.

Finally, whilst it’s good to see increasing adoption of two-factor authentication (TOTP Two-Factor Authentication, Platforms #44; assess), we mustn’t let ourselves see this as a panacea (Schneier, “Two-Factor Authentication: Too Little, Too Late”), we must continue to be rigorous about our security solutions.


The Web Way

Sonian and ThoughtWorks seem to be similarly vested in the Web as more than just for web sites (“Web as platform”, Jan 2011 radar; adopt).  REST APIs are seemingly ubiquitous, and a modern web UI is mandatory. The JavaScript Cambrian explosion continues, and is even called out in this Tech Radar headlines page.  Thankfully, software engineering practices around the front end are more and more commonplace.  “Segregated DOM plus node for JS testing” (Techniques #2; adopt) and “Handwritten CSS” (Languages #106; hold) are at quite different ends of the front end spectrum, but both represent a focus on sustainable, maintainable code in a team setting.  Some interesting points for me in this area were Grunt.js (Tools #59; trial) being only in “Trial”, and Leaflet.js (Tools #73; assess) barely squeaking in to “Assess”: both are stable, well-adopted tools with good APIs, good documentation and active communities, and they are generally far superior to those things they displace (hand rolled asset pipeline scripts anyone?).  Given the amount of front end work I suspect ThoughtWorks are doing, these valuable tools seem under-represented.

On the back-end side, Swagger (Tools #78; assess) and HAL (Languages #89; trial) demonstrate the continual tension between a laissez-faire approach of “getting things done” (perhaps at the expense of communicating exactly what has been done) and standards-based discoverable services (and XML overload).  Whilst treading the fine line between the equally undesirable ends of this spectrum, I think it’s great to see lightweight standards and automatable tools such as these emerge. They are easy for API providers to adopt, and make it easier for end users to understand, test, and consume the API.

Pipelines

Continuous Delivery and DevOps themes are everywhere now, and ThoughtWorks have been loudly sounding the call.  This radar covers the old and the new.  “Chaos Monkeys” (Tools #53; trial) breaking your stack combined with “Focus on mean time to recovery” (Techniques #6, trial) has to be the apotheosis of the Continuous Integration mantra of “if it hurts, do it more frequently”.  Netflix’s Simian army and the all-or-nothing approach to ensuring the stack is operational under some fairly extreme conditions, combined with a systematic, quantitative approach to measuring and optimizing quality of service in the event of failures must be the surest way to build high confidence in the fault tolerance of your entire infrastructure.

Continuous Delivery is a huge incremental step beyond Continuous Integration.  The rise in popularity of containerization and virtualization tools like Docker (Tools #54; trial) and Packer (Tools #62; trial) are surely driven by the difficulty in achieving an end-to-end CD pipeline, and ideas like “Machine image as a build artifact” (Techniques #10; trial) point out the one thing missing from this (and the previous) tech radars: all the tools, languages, techniques and platforms are useless without skilled, motivated, trained people.
